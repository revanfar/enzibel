These files are my own project to automate installing applications on ubuntu using ansible playbook.
Files are written in YAML format which is a standard format used by ansible.

By default, I use "trystack" name as my host on ansible and it is configured on /etc/ansible/hosts.
You should edit it and replace with your own name.

To execute these files, just simply type

 #ansible-playbook file.yaml

You can use it for fun and free!
Enjoy
